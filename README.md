# Music Modus 
>Consumption of music and information.


[Deployed Site](https://wandrew8.github.io/ProjectOne/)

Music Modus is an interactive web based application built with purpose of providing a resource for users to learn more about the artists and the songs that they love. This application takes the users' input from the search field and returns information on the artist, a censored or uncensored copy of the lyrics, and displays a YouTube video of the artist and their song. 


## Development setup

To use this application simply open the deployed link and enjoy all of the information that is now at your fingertips. You can now search, read, and listen the way that you want to.
